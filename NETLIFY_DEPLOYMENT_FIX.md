# ðŸš€ Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue: "Site not found" Error
Your Netlify URL `https://idyllic-kitsune-f5a020.netlify.app` is returning "Site not found"

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Check Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. Check if your site is listed in your dashboard
3. Look for any failed deployments (red X marks)

### 2. Re-deploy from GitHub
If the site exists but failed to deploy:

```bash
# Push a new commit to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment - trigger rebuild"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Manual Netlify Deployment
If the site doesn't exist, create a new one:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Choose GitHub and select your repository
4. Use these settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: 18

### 4. Alternative: Direct File Upload
If GitHub integration fails:

```bash
# Build locally first
npm install
npm run build

# Then drag and drop the 'dist' folder to Netlify
```

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: Build Failure
**Symptoms**: Red X in Netlify dashboard
**Solution**: Check build logs and fix any errors

### Issue 2: Wrong Build Settings
**Symptoms**: Site deploys but shows blank page
**Solution**: Verify build command and publish directory

### Issue 3: Environment Variables
**Symptoms**: Site works locally but not on Netlify
**Solution**: Add any required environment variables in Netlify settings

## Alternative Hosting Options:

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended backup)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import from GitHub
3. Auto-detects React/Vite settings
4. One-click deployment

### Option 2: GitHub Pages
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts:
"deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"

# Install gh-pages
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

### Option 3: Surge.sh (Quick & Simple)
```bash
# Install surge globally
npm install -g surge

# Build and deploy
npm run build
cd dist
surge
```

## Verification Steps:
After deployment, check:
1. âœ… Site loads without errors
2. âœ… Navigation works (all routes)
3. âœ… PDF downloads function
4. âœ… Forms submit properly
5. âœ… Images load correctly

## Emergency Contact:
If all deployment methods fail, the project is ready for any static hosting service. All dependencies are properly configured and the build process is optimized.
