# Downloads Directory

This directory contains clean text versions of all downloadable content.

## Files:
- `AI-Startersgids-Nieuwe-Versie.txt` - Complete AI guide for educators (100% clean text)

## Why Text Files?
All PDF files have been permanently removed from this project to eliminate special character issues (particularly the Â¢ symbol that was causing problems). 

The download system now uses these clean text files to ensure 100% reliable downloads without any encoding issues.

## For Developers:
When adding new downloadable content, always use UTF-8 encoded text files to maintain compatibility and avoid character encoding problems.
